# WaveGame
A multiplayer unity project by Huske.

Installation instructions:
1. Extract rar file to a location of your choosing.
2. If you wish to play multiplayer you may need to set WaveGame.exe as a non-steam game to access the steam overlay.
3. Play solo or Invite friends via steam overlay! (Friends can also join you)

Information:
The game will show up as 'SpaceWar' on your steam activity. SpaceWar is a steamworks testing application for networking.
Since WaveGame does not have it's own steam appID, I use SpaceWars.
